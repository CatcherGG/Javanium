# Javanium

Javanium is a simple blockchain java framework. It's meant to be a simple implementation for blockchain and other related technologies and to be used for testing / studying the technology with Java language.

## Blockchain

Javanium blockchain is pretty similiar to Bitcoin logic. Except that I've been using SHA512 as the main hashing algorithem, while Bitcoin uses SHA256. Other than that it should have similar logic.

In order to make it persistent the blockchain itself is stored in MapDB (Embedded noSQL DB)

## Current status
I'm still working on consensus implementation.
